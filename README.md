## CityTeam Guest Registration Application - Client Tests

This project contains integration tests that exercize the REST endpoints
of the CityTeam Guests Application.  In order to function correctly, a
server *must* be running, and its database provisionable with the test
data that is used by internal tests of the guests-service module.

These tests should generally parallel the functional tests for the
guests-service module, for each endpoint that corresponds to a service
method.
